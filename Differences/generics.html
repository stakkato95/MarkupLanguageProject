                <h3>Type erasure versus reified generics</h3>

                <p>
                    Generics in Java are a language-only construction; they are implemented only in the compiler. The
                    generated classfiles include generic signatures only in form of metadata (allowing the compiler to
                    compile new classes against them). The runtime has no knowledge of the generic type system; generics
                    are not part of the JVM. Instead, generics classes and methods are transformed during compilation
                    through a process known as type erasure. During this process the compiler replaces all generic types
                    with their raw version and inserts casts/checks appropriately in client code where the type and its
                    methods are used. The resulting byte code will contain no references to any generic types or
                    parameters (See also Generics in Java).<br><br>
                    The language specification intentionally prohibits certain uses of generics; this is necessary to
                    allow for implementing generics through type erasure, and to allow for migration
                    compatibility.<br><br>
                    C# builds on support for generics from the virtual execution system itself, i.e. it is not just a
                    language feature. The language is merely a front-end for cross-language generics support in the CLR.
                    During compilation generics are verified for correctness, but code generation for actually
                    implementing the generics are deferred to class-load time. Client code (code invoking generic
                    methods/properties) are fully compiled and can safely assume generics to be type-safe. This is
                    called reification. At runtime, when a unique set of type parameters for a generic
                    class/method/delegate is encountered for the first time, the class loader/verifier will synthesize a
                    concrete class descriptor and generate method implementations. During the generation of method
                    implementations all reference types will be considered a single type, as reference types can safely
                    share the same implementations. Note, this is merely for the purpose of implementing code. Different
                    sets of reference types will still have unique type descriptors; their method tables will merely
                    point to the same code.<br><br>
                    The following list illustrates some differences between Java and C# when managing generics. It is
                    not exhaustive:

                            Compared to non-generic code with manual casts, these casts will be the same,[56] but
                            compared to compile-time verified code that would not need runtime casts and checks, these
                            operations represent a performance overhead.

                            non-generic (or type-erased) code that require casts when handling non-generic or
                            type-erased objects.

                            as the wrappers will be heap-allocated as opposed to stack-allocated.

                <p>
                    C# allows generics directly for primitive types. Java, instead, allows the use of boxed types as
                    type parameters (e.g., List &lt;Integer&gt; instead of List&lt;int&gt;). This comes at a cost since
                    all such values need to be boxed/unboxed when used, and they all need to be heap-allocated. However,
                    a generic type can be specialized with an array type of a primitive type in Java, for example List&lt;int[]&gt;
                    is allowed.

            <p>During the development of the .NET Framework, the class libraries were originally written using a
                managed code compiler system called Simple Managed C (SMC). In January 1999, Anders Hejlsberg formed
                a team to build a new language at the time called Cool, which stood for "C-like Object Oriented
                Language". Microsoft had considered keeping the name "Cool" as the final name of the language, but
                chose not to do so for trademark reasons. By the time the .NET project was publicly announced at the
                July 2000 Professional Developers Conference, the language had been renamed C#, and the class
                libraries and ASP.NET runtime had been ported to C#.</p>
