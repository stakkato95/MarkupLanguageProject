                <h3>Operator Overloading in C#</h3>

                <p>
                    C# allows you to overload operators for use on your own classes. This makes it possible for a
                    user-defined data type to look as natural and be as logical to use as a fundamental data type. For
                    example, you might create a new data type called ComplexNumber to represent a complex number, and
                    provide methods that perform mathematical operations on such numbers using the standard arithmetic
                    operators, such as using the + operator to add two complex numbers.
                    To overload an operator, you write a function that has the name operator followed by the symbol for
                    the operator to be overloaded. For instance, this is how you would overload the + operator:<br><br>

                    public static ComplexNumber operator+(ComplexNumber a, ComplexNumber b)<br><br>

                    All operator overloads are static methods of the class. Also be aware that if you overload the
                    equality (==) operator, you must overload the inequality operator (!=) as well. The < and >
                    operators, and the <= and >= operators should also be overloaded in pairs.
                    The full list of operators that can be overloaded is:
                <ul>
                    <li> Unary operators: +, -, !, ~, ++, --, true, false</li>
                    <li> Binary operators: +, -, *, /, %, &, |, ^, <<, >>, ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=</li>
                </ul>


                </p>

                <p>
                    Java doesn't have operator overloading. You have to work around.

            <p>During the development of the .NET Framework, the class libraries were originally written using a
                managed code compiler system called Simple Managed C (SMC). In January 1999, Anders Hejlsberg formed
                a team to build a new language at the time called Cool, which stood for "C-like Object Oriented
                Language". Microsoft had considered keeping the name "Cool" as the final name of the language, but
                chose not to do so for trademark reasons. By the time the .NET project was publicly announced at the
                July 2000 Professional Developers Conference, the language had been renamed C#, and the class
                libraries and ASP.NET runtime had been ported to C#.</p>
