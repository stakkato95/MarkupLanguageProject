                <h3>Short comparison of implementation</h3>

                <p>
                    Both languages define enumerations, but they are implemented in fundamentally different ways. As
                    such, enumerations are one area where tools designed to automatically translate code between the two
                    languages (such as Java to C# converters) fail.<br><br>
                    C# has implemented enumerations in a manner similar to C, that is as wrappers around the bit-flags
                    implemented in primitive integral types (int, byte, short, etc.). This has performance benefits and
                    improves interaction with C/C++ compiled code, but provides fewer features and can lead to bugs if
                    low-level value types are directly cast to an enumeration type, as is allowed in the C# language. In
                    contrast, Java implements enumerations as full featured collection of instances, requiring more
                    memory and not aiding interaction with C/C++ code, but providing additional features in reflection
                    and intrinsic behavior. The implementation in each language is described in the table below.

                <table>
                    <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <th></th>
                        <th>Java</th>
                        <th>C#</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Definition</td>
                        <td>In Java, the enumeration type is a class, and its values are objects (instances) of that
                            class. The only valid values are the ones listed in the enumeration. The enumeration type
                            may declare fields, allowing each individual enumerated value to reference additional data
                            associated uniquely with that specific value. The enumeration type may also declare or
                            override methods, or implement interfaces.
                        </td>
                        <td>Enumerations in C# are implicitly derived from the Enum type that again is a value type
                            derivative. The value set of a C# enumeration is defined by the underlying type that can be
                            a signed or unsigned integer type of 8, 16, 32 or 64 bits. The enumeration definition
                            defines names for the selected integer values.[18][19] By default the first name is assigned
                            the value 0 (zero) and the following names are assigned in increments of 1. Any value of the
                            underlying primitive type is a valid value of the enumeration type, though an explicit cast
                            may be needed to assign it.

                        <td>Combining</td>
                        <td>Java enumeration set and map collections provide functionality to combine multiple
                            enumeration values to a combined value. These special collections allows compiler
                            optimization to minimize the overhead incurred by using collections as the combination
                            mechanism.
                        </td>
                        <td>C# supports bit-mapped enumerations where an actual value may be a combination of enumerated
                            values bitwise or'ed together. The formatting and parsing methods implicitly defined by the
                            type will attempt to use these values.

                    </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>

                <br>In both C# and Java, programmers can use enumerations in a switch statement without conversion to a
                string or primitive integer type. However, C# disallows fall-throughs unless the case statement does not
                contain any code, as they are a main cause for hard-to-find bugs. Fall-throughs must be explicitly
                declared using goto case

                <h3>C# enums features</h3>

                <p>
                    The enum keyword is used to declare an enumeration, a distinct type that consists of a set of named
                    constants called the enumerator list. Usually it is best to define an enum directly within a
                    namespace so that all classes in the
                    namespace can access it with equal convenience. However, an enum can also be nested within a class
                    or struct.<br><br>
                    By default, the first enumerator has the value 0, and the value of each successive enumerator is
                    increased by 1. For example, in the following enumeration, Sat is 0, Sun is 1, Mon is 2, and so
                    forth.

                <pre>enum Days {Sat, Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri};</pre>

                Enumerators can use initializers to override the default values, as shown in the following example.

                <pre>enum Days {Sat=1, Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri};</pre>

                In this enumeration, the sequence of elements is forced to start from 1 instead of 0. However, including
                a constant that has the value of 0 is recommended.<br><br>
                Every enumeration type has an underlying type, which can be any integral type except char. The default
                underlying type of enumeration elements is int. To declare an enum of another integral type, such as
                byte, use a colon after the identifier followed by the type, as shown in the following example.

                <pre>enum Days : byte {Sat=1, Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri};</pre>

                The approved types for an enum are byte, sbyte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, or ulong.
                A variable of type Days can be assigned any value in the range of the underlying type; the values are
                not limited to the named constants.

                <h3>Java enums features</h3>

                <p>
                    Java programming language enum types are much more powerful than their counterparts in other
                    languages. The enum declaration defines a class (called an enum type). The enum class body can
                    include methods and other fields. The compiler automatically adds some special methods when it
                    creates an enum. For example, they have a static values method that returns an array containing all
                    of the values of the enum in the order they are declared.<br><br>
                    In the following example, Planet is an enum type that represents the planets in the solar system.
                    They are defined with constant mass and radius properties.<br><br>
                    Each enum constant is declared with values for the mass and radius parameters. These values are
                    passed to the constructor when the constant is created. Java requires that the constants be defined
                    first, prior to any fields or methods. Also, when there are fields and methods, the list of enum
                    constants must end with a semicolon.<br><br>
                    In addition to its properties and constructor, Planet has methods that allow you to retrieve the
                    surface gravity and weight of an object on each planet. Here is a sample program that takes your
                    weight on earth (in any unit) and calculates and prints your weight on all of the planets (in the
                    same unit):

                <pre>public enum Planet {
    MERCURY (3.303e+23, 2.4397e6),
    VENUS   (4.869e+24, 6.0518e6),
    EARTH   (5.976e+24, 6.37814e6),
    MARS    (6.421e+23, 3.3972e6),
    JUPITER (1.9e+27,   7.1492e7),
    SATURN  (5.688e+26, 6.0268e7),
    URANUS  (8.686e+25, 2.5559e7),
    NEPTUNE (1.024e+26, 2.4746e7);

    private final double mass;   // in kilograms
    private final double radius; // in meters
    Planet(double mass, double radius) {
        this.mass = mass;
        this.radius = radius;
    }
    private double mass() { return mass; }
    private double radius() { return radius; }

    // universal gravitational constant  (m3 kg-1 s-2)
    public static final double G = 6.67300E-11;

    double surfaceGravity() {
        return G * mass / (radius * radius);
    }
    double surfaceWeight(double otherMass) {
        return otherMass * surfaceGravity();
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if (args.length != 1) {
            System.err.println("Usage: java Planet &lt;earth_weight&gt;");
                    System.exit(-1);
        }
        double earthWeight = Double.parseDouble(args[0]);
        double mass = earthWeight/EARTH.surfaceGravity();
        for (Planet p : Planet.values())
            System.out.printf("Your weight on %s is %f%n",
                    p, p.surfaceWeight(mass));
    }
}</pre>

            <p>During the development of the .NET Framework, the class libraries were originally written using a
                managed code compiler system called Simple Managed C (SMC). In January 1999, Anders Hejlsberg formed
                a team to build a new language at the time called Cool, which stood for "C-like Object Oriented
                Language". Microsoft had considered keeping the name "Cool" as the final name of the language, but
                chose not to do so for trademark reasons. By the time the .NET project was publicly announced at the
                July 2000 Professional Developers Conference, the language had been renamed C#, and the class
                libraries and ASP.NET runtime had been ported to C#.</p>
