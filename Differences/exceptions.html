                <h3>Exceptions in C#</h3>

                <p>
                    There are two types of exceptions: exceptions generated by an executing program, and exceptions
                    generated by the common language runtime. In addition, there is a hierarchy of exceptions that can
                    be thrown by either an application or the runtime.<br><br>
                    Exception is the base class for exceptions. Several exception classes inherit directly from
                    Exception, including ApplicationException and SystemException. These two classes form the basis for
                    almost all runtime exceptions. Most exceptions that derive directly from Exception add no
                    functionality to the Exception class.<br><br>
                    The runtime throws the appropriate derived class of SystemException when errors occur. These errors
                    result from failed runtime checks (such as array out-of-bound errors), and can occur during the
                    execution of any method. If you are designing an application that creates new exceptions, you should
                    derive those exceptions from the Exception class. It is not recommended that you catch a
                    SystemException, nor is it good programming practice to throw a SystemException in your application.
                    The most severe exceptions — those thrown by the runtime or in nonrecoverable conditions — include
                    ExecutionEngineException, StackOverflowException, and OutOfMemoryException.<br><br>
                    Interoperation exceptions derive from SystemException and are further extended by ExternalException.
                    For example, COMException is the exception thrown during COM interop operations and derives from
                    ExternalException. Win32Exception and SEHException also derive from ExternalException.

                <h3>Access modifiers in Java</h3>

                <p>
                    Java supports checked exceptions (in addition to unchecked exceptions). C# only supports unchecked
                    exceptions. Checked exceptions force the programmer to either declare the exception thrown in a
                    method, or to catch the thrown exception using a try-catch clause.<br><br>
                    Checked exceptions can encourage good programming practice, ensuring that all errors are dealt with.
                    However Anders Hejlsberg, chief C# language architect, argues that they were to some extent an
                    experiment in Java and that they have not been shown to be worthwhile except in small example
                    programs.<br><br>
                    One criticism is that checked exceptions encourage programmers to use an empty catch block (catch
                    (Exception e) {}), which silently swallows exceptions, rather than letting the exceptions
                    propagate to a higher-level exception-handling routine. In some cases, however, exception chaining
                    can be applied instead, by re-throwing the exception in a wrapper exception. For example, if an
                    object is changed to access a database instead of a file, an SQLException could be caught and
                    re-thrown as an IOException, since the caller may not need to know the inner workings of the object.<br><br>
                    However, not all programmers agree with this stance, with James Gosling and others maintaining that
                    checked exceptions are a good idea and it's people misusing them that cause the issues. Silently
                    catching exceptions is possible, yes, but you have to explicitly say what you want to do with the
                    exception as opposed to unchecked exceptions that let you do nothing by default. You can ignore it,
                    but you have to explicitly write code to ignore it.<br><br>
                    Checked exceptions are marked in red, unchecked exceptions are marked in green:
