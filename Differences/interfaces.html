                <h3>Interfaces in C#</h3>

                <p>
                    An interface contains definitions for a group of related functionalities that a class or a struct
                    can implement.
                    By using interfaces, you can, for example, include behavior from multiple sources in a class. That
                    capability is important in C# because the language doesn't support multiple inheritance of classes.
                    In addition, you must use an interface if you want to simulate inheritance for structs, because they
                    can't actually inherit from another struct or class.
                    You define an interface by using the interface keyword, as the following example shows.

                    <pre>interface IEquatable&lt;T&gt;
{
    bool Equals(T obj);
}
</pre>


                Any class or struct that implements the IEquatable
                &lt;T&gt; interface must contain a definition for an Equals method that matches the signature that the
                interface specifies. As a result, you can count on a class that implements IEquatable
                &lt;T&gt; to contain an Equals method with which an instance of the class can determine whether it's
                equal to another instance of the same class.<br><br>
                The definition of IEquatable &lt;T&gt; doesn’t provide an implementation for Equals. The interface
                defines only the signature. In that way, an interface in C# is similar to an abstract class in which all
                the methods are abstract. However, a class or struct can implement multiple interfaces, but a class can
                inherit only a single class, abstract or not. Therefore, by using interfaces, you can include behavior
                from multiple sources in a class.<br><br>
                Interfaces can contain methods, properties, events, indexers, or any combination of those four member
                types. For links to examples, see Related Sections. An interface can't contain constants, fields,
                operators, instance constructors, destructors, or types. Interface members are automatically public, and
                they can't include any access modifiers. Members also can't be static.<br><br>
                To implement an interface member, the corresponding member of the implementing class must be public,
                non-static, and have the same name and signature as the interface member.<br><br>
                When a class or struct implements an interface, the class or struct must provide an implementation for
                all of the members that the interface defines. The interface itself provides no functionality that a
                class or struct can inherit in the way that it can inherit base class functionality. However, if a base
                class implements an interface, any class that's derived from the base class inherits that
                implementation.

                An interface has the following properties:
                <ul>
                    <li>An interface is like an abstract base class. Any class or struct that implements the interface
                        must implement all its members.
                    </li>
                    <li>An interface can't be instantiated directly. Its members are implemented by any class or struct
                        that implements the interface.
                    </li>
                    <li>Interfaces can contain events, indexers, methods, and properties.</li>
                    <li>Interfaces contain no implementation of methods.</li>
                    <li>A class or struct can implement multiple interfaces. A class can inherit a base class and also
                        implement one or more interfaces.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                </p>

                <h3>Explicit interface implementation in C#</h3>

                <p>
                    If a class implements two interfaces that contain a member with the same signature, then
                    implementing that member on the class will cause both interfaces to use that member as their
                    implementation. In the following example, all the calls to Paint invoke the same method.
                    <pre>class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        SampleClass sc = new SampleClass();
        IControl ctrl = (IControl)sc;
        ISurface srfc = (ISurface)sc;

        // The following lines all call the same method.
        sc.Paint();
        ctrl.Paint();
        srfc.Paint();
    }
}


interface IControl
{
    void Paint();
}
interface ISurface
{
    void Paint();
}
class SampleClass : IControl, ISurface
{
    // Both ISurface.Paint and IControl.Paint call this method.
    public void Paint()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Paint method in SampleClass");
    }
}

// Output:
// Paint method in SampleClass
// Paint method in SampleClass
// Paint method in SampleClass</pre>

                If the two interface members do not perform the same function, however, this can lead to an incorrect
                implementation of one or both of the interfaces. It is possible to implement an interface member
                explicitly—creating a class member that is only called through the interface, and is specific to that
                interface. This is accomplished by naming the class member with the name of the interface and a period.
                For example:

                <pre>public class SampleClass : IControl, ISurface
{
    void IControl.Paint()
    {
        System.Console.WriteLine("IControl.Paint");
    }
    void ISurface.Paint()
    {
        System.Console.WriteLine("ISurface.Paint");
    }
}</pre>

                The class member IControl.Paint is only available through the IControl interface, and ISurface.Paint is
                only available through ISurface. Both method implementations are separate, and neither is available
                directly on the class. For example:

                <pre>// Call the Paint methods from Main.

SampleClass obj = new SampleClass();
//obj.Paint();  // Compiler error.

IControl c = (IControl)obj;
c.Paint();  // Calls IControl.Paint on SampleClass.

ISurface s = (ISurface)obj;
s.Paint(); // Calls ISurface.Paint on SampleClass.

// Output:
// IControl.Paint
// ISurface.Paint</pre>

                Explicit implementation is also used to resolve cases where two interfaces each declare different
                members of the same name such as a property and a method:

                <pre>interface ILeft
{
    int P { get;}
}
interface IRight
{
    int P();
}</pre>

                To implement both interfaces, a class has to use explicit implementation either for the property P, or
                the method P, or both, to avoid a compiler error. For example:

                <pre>class Middle : ILeft, IRight
{
    public int P() { return 0; }
    int ILeft.P { get { return 0; } }
}</pre>

                </p>

            </div>

            <div class="articleDiv">
                <h3>Interfaces in Java</h3>

                <p>
                    An interface declaration consists of modifiers, the keyword interface, the interface name, a
                    comma-separated list of parent interfaces (if any), and the interface body. For example:
                <pre>public interface GroupedInterface extends Interface1, Interface2, Interface3 {

    // constant declarations

    // base of natural logarithms
    double E = 2.718282;

    // method signatures
    void doSomething (int i, double x);
    int doSomethingElse(String s);
}
                </pre>

                <p/>

                <h3>Evolving interfaces in Java</h3>

                <p>
                    Consider an interface that you have developed called DoIt:
                    <pre>public interface DoIt {
   void doSomething(int i, double x);
   int doSomethingElse(String s);
}</pre>
                Suppose that, at a later time, you want to add a third method to DoIt, so that the interface now
                becomes:

                <pre>public interface DoIt {

   void doSomething(int i, double x);
   int doSomethingElse(String s);
   boolean didItWork(int i, double x, String s);

}</pre>

                If you make this change, then all classes that implement the old DoIt interface will break because they
                no longer implement the old interface. Programmers relying on this interface will protest
                loudly.<br><br>
                Try to anticipate all uses for your interface and specify it completely from the beginning. If you want
                to add additional methods to an interface, you have several options. You could create a DoItPlus
                interface that extends DoIt:

                <pre>public interface DoItPlus extends DoIt {

   boolean didItWork(int i, double x, String s);

}</pre>

                Now users of your code can choose to continue to use the old interface or to upgrade to the new
                interface.<br><br>
                Alternatively, you can define your new methods as default methods. The following example defines a
                default method named didItWork:

                <pre>public interface DoIt {

   void doSomething(int i, double x);
   int doSomethingElse(String s);
   default boolean didItWork(int i, double x, String s) {
       // Method body
   }

}</pre>

                Note that you must provide an implementation for default methods. You could also define new static
                methods to existing interfaces. Users who have classes that implement interfaces enhanced with new
                default or static methods do not have to modify or recompile them to accommodate the additional methods.

                </p>

                <h3>Default interface methods in Java</h3>

                <p>
                    Default methods enable you to add new functionality to the interfaces of your libraries and ensure
                    binary compatibility with code written for older versions of those interfaces.<br><br>
                    Consider the following interface, TimeClient:

                    <pre>public interface TimeClient {
    void setTime(int hour, int minute, int second);
    void setDate(int day, int month, int year);
    void setDateAndTime(int day, int month, int year,
                               int hour, int minute, int second);
    LocalDateTime getLocalDateTime();
}</pre>

                Suppose that you want to add new functionality to the TimeClient interface, such as the ability to
                specify a time zone through a ZonedDateTime object (which is like a LocalDateTime object except that it
                stores time zone information):

                <pre>public interface TimeClient {
    void setTime(int hour, int minute, int second);
    void setDate(int day, int month, int year);
    void setDateAndTime(int day, int month, int year,
        int hour, int minute, int second);
    LocalDateTime getLocalDateTime();
    ZonedDateTime getZonedDateTime(String zoneString);
}</pre>

                Following this modification to the TimeClient interface, you would also have to modify the class
                SimpleTimeClient and implement the method getZonedDateTime. However, rather than leaving
                getZonedDateTime as abstract (as in the previous example), you can instead define a default
                implementation. (Remember that an abstract method is a method declared without an implementation.)

                <pre>public class TestSimpleTimeClient {
    public static void main(String... args) {
        TimeClient myTimeClient = new SimpleTimeClient();
        System.out.println("Current time: " + myTimeClient.toString());
        System.out.println("Time in California: " +
            myTimeClient.getZonedDateTime("Blah blah").toString());
    }
}</pre>

                </p>
