                <h3>Information technologies in Belarus</h3>

                <img src="../img/dev_1.png">

                <p>
                    Curiously enough, among myriads of blogs and social services, which have appeared lately, there is not so much
                    ones for people (programmers, Q&As and other ones who is connected with IT) who have built them. Such an imbalance
                    has been mended and a project dev.by has been launched for belorussian IT people.<br><br>
                    In IT it's not a secret that a main secret is a salary. It is so happened that to find an information about who and
                    how much earns for nis or her programming work is hardly possible even among friends and office colleagues. So
                    seeking to provide with an adequate assessment of the labor market in IT-industry, dev.by with the help of
                    belorussian IT specialists collects and publishes information about about salaries considering speciality,
                    employee experience and technologies he or she uses.
                </p>

                <h3>C#</h3>

                <img src="../img/dev_2.JPG">

                <p>
                    According to the site dev.by there is just 13 job vacancies in Belarus and among them only one proposal in Grodno.
                    The only specified salary is 1500$.
                </p>

                <h3>Java</h3>

                <img src="../img/dev_3.JPG">

                <p>
                    With Java development situation is significantly different. Proceeding from search result, Java developers have 49
                    potential vacancies. In addition they can rely on salary from 1000$ to 3500$. In Grodno the amount of free vacancies
                    is equal to 2.

            <p>During the development of the .NET Framework, the class libraries were originally written using a
                managed code compiler system called Simple Managed C (SMC). In January 1999, Anders Hejlsberg formed
                a team to build a new language at the time called Cool, which stood for "C-like Object Oriented
                Language". Microsoft had considered keeping the name "Cool" as the final name of the language, but
                chose not to do so for trademark reasons. By the time the .NET project was publicly announced at the
                July 2000 Professional Developers Conference, the language had been renamed C#, and the class
                libraries and ASP.NET runtime had been ported to C#.</p>
