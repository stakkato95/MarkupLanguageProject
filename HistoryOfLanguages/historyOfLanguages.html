                <h3>History of C#</h3>

                <p>During the development of the .NET Framework, the class libraries were originally written using a
                    managed code compiler system called Simple Managed C (SMC). In January 1999, Anders Hejlsberg formed
                    a team to build a new language at the time called Cool, which stood for "C-like Object Oriented
                    Language". Microsoft had considered keeping the name "Cool" as the final name of the language, but
                    chose not to do so for trademark reasons. By the time the .NET project was publicly announced at the
                    July 2000 Professional Developers Conference, the language had been renamed C#, and the class
                    libraries and ASP.NET runtime had been ported to C#.<br/><br/>

                    C#'s principal designer and lead architect at Microsoft is Anders Hejlsberg, who was previously
                    involved with the design of Turbo Pascal, Embarcadero Delphi (formerly CodeGear Delphi, Inprise
                    Delphi and Borland Delphi), and Visual J++. In interviews and technical papers he has stated that
                    flaws in most major programming languages (e.g. C++, Java, Delphi, and Smalltalk) drove the
                    fundamentals of the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which, in turn, drove the design of the C#
                    language itself.<br/><br/>

                    James Gosling, who created the Java programming language in 1994, and Bill Joy, a co-founder of Sun
                    Microsystems, the originator of Java, called C# an "imitation" of Java; Gosling further said that
                    "[C# is] sort of Java with reliability, productivity and security deleted." Klaus Kreft and Angelika
                    Langer (authors of a C++ streams book) stated in a blog post that "Java and C# are almost identical
                    programming languages. Boring repetition that lacks innovation," "Hardly anybody will claim that
                    Java or C# are revolutionary programming languages that changed the way we write programs," and "C#
                    borrowed a lot from Java - and vice versa. Now that C# supports boxing and unboxing, we'll have a
                    very similar feature in Java." In July 2000, Anders Hejlsberg said that C# is "not a Java clone" and
                    is "much closer to C++" in its design.<br/><br/>

                    Since the release of C# 2.0 in November 2005, the C# and Java languages have evolved on increasingly
                    divergent trajectories, becoming somewhat less similar. One of the first major departures came with
                    the addition of generics to both languages, with vastly different implementations. C# makes use of
                    reification to provide "first-class" generic objects that can be used like any other class, with
                    code generation performed at class-load time. By contrast, Java's generics are essentially a
                    language syntax feature, and they do not affect the generated byte code, because the compiler
                    performs type erasure on the generic type information after it has verified its
                    correctness.<br/><br/>

                    Furthermore, C# has added several major features to accommodate functional-style programming,
                    culminating in the LINQ extensions released with C# 3.0 and its supporting framework of lambda
                    expressions, extension methods, and anonymous types. These features enable C# programmers to use
                    functional programming techniques, such as closures, when it is advantageous to their application.
                    The LINQ extensions and the functional imports help developers reduce the amount of "boilerplate"
                    code that is included in common tasks like querying a database, parsing an xml file, or searching
                    through a data structure, shifting the emphasis onto the actual program logic to help improve
                    readability and maintainability.

                <h3>Name of C#</h3>

                <p>
                    The name "C sharp" was inspired by musical notation where a sharp indicates that the written note
                    should be made a semitone higher in pitch. This is similar to the language name of C++, where "++"
                    indicates that a variable should be incremented by 1. The sharp symbol also resembles a ligature of
                    four "+" symbols (in a two-by-two grid), further implying that the language is an increment of C++.<br><br><br><br>

                <h3>History of Java</h3>

                <p>
                    James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June
                    1991. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the
                    digital cable television industry at the time. The language was initially called Oak after an
                    oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was
                    finally renamed Java, from Java coffee. Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that
                    system and application programmers would find familiar.<br><br>

                    Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1995. It promised "Write
                    Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA), providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. Fairly secure and
                    featuring configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions. Major web
                    browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within web pages, and Java quickly became
                    popular. The Java 1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly with the
                    Java 1.0 language specification. With the advent of Java 2 (released initially as J2SE 1.2 in
                    December 1998 – 1999), new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of
                    platforms. J2EE included technologies and APIs for enterprise applications typically run in server
                    environments, while J2ME featured APIs optimized for mobile applications. The desktop version was
                    renamed J2SE. In 2006, for marketing purposes, Sun renamed new J2 versions as Java EE, Java ME, and
                    Java SE, respectively.<br><br>

                    In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO/IEC JTC 1 standards body and later the Ecma
                    International to formalize Java, but it soon withdrew from the process. Java remains a
                    de facto standard, controlled through the Java Community Process. At one time, Sun made most of
                    its Java implementations available without charge, despite their proprietary software status. Sun
                    generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for specialized products such as the
                    Java Enterprise System.<br><br>

                    On November 13, 2006, Sun released much of Java as free and open-source software, (FOSS), under the
                    terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). On May 8, 2007, Sun finished the process, making all
                    of Java's core code available under free software/open-source distribution terms, aside from a small
                    portion of code to which Sun did not hold the copyright.<br><br>

                    Sun's vice-president Rich Green said that Sun's ideal role with regard to Java was as an
                    "evangelist". Following Oracle Corporation's acquisition of Sun Microsystems in 2009–2010,
                    Oracle has described itself as the "steward of Java technology with a relentless commitment to
                    fostering a community of participation and transparency". This did not prevent Oracle from
                    filing a lawsuit against Google shortly after that for using Java inside the Android SDK (see Google
                    section below). Java software runs on everything from laptops to data centers, game consoles to
                    scientific supercomputers. On April 2, 2010, James Gosling resigned from Oracle.
