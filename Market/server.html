                    The one consistency that binds all modern devices and operating systems is the internet browser. Web
                    applications are something that most of us are familiar with, and their key asset is their ability
                    to offer a consistent user experience regardless of what device or operating system you are
                    using.<br><br>
                    As more and more applications become delivered via the web, or are web born, it stands to reason
                    that users will want a single online desktop that offers a consistent experience which can be
                    accessed from anywhere in the globe.<br><br>
                    Ultimately consistency promotes productivity; a web desktop offers the opportunity to log in
                    instantly from any device, bringing the user to an environment that they are familiar with and is
                    set up to suit their needs.<br><br>
                    Web desktops also mean users can dynamically add new applications, seamlessly pull in news and sync
                    social feeds. The user is in full control of their entire experience. It is also much cheaper to
                    deploy and manage, so IT managers and CFO's will like it too.<br><br>
                    The desktop no longer belongs to the OS – the desktop now belongs to the user. We must set the
                    desktop free of the OS, enabling us to get the most out of our experience, be it at our desks or on
                    the move.

                <h3>Today's market state</h3>

                <p>
                    This is probably the arena in which the two platforms are closest to being considered rivals. Java,
                    through its Java EE (a.k.a. Java Platform Enterprise Edition) platform, and .NET through ASP.NET,
                    compete to create web-based dynamic content and applications.<br><br>
                    Both platforms are well used and supported in this market. Of the top 10,000 websites, approximately
                    24% use ASP.net and 8% use Java.<br><br>
                    Some of Oracle's Java-related license agreements for Java EE define aspects of the Java platform as
                    a trade secret, and prohibit the end user from contributing to a third-party Java environment.
                    Specifically, at least one current license for an Oracle Java EE development package contains the
                    following terms: "You may make a single archival copy of Software, but otherwise may not copy,
                    modify, or distribute Software." — "Unless enforcement is prohibited by applicable law, you may not
                    decompile, or reverse engineer Software." — "You may not publish or provide the results of any
                    benchmark or comparison tests run on Software to any third party without the prior written consent
                    of Oracle." — "Software is confidential and copyrighted." However, while Oracle's software is
                    subject to the above license terms, Oracle's Java EE API reference has been implemented under an
                    open-source license by the JBoss and JOnAS projects.<br><br>
                    Microsoft's implementation of ASP.NET is not part of the standardized CLI, and while Microsoft's
                    runtime environment and development tools are not subject to comparable secrecy agreements to Java
                    EE, the official Microsoft tools are not open source or free software, and require Windows servers.
                    However, a cross-platform free software ASP.NET implementation is part of the Mono project (minus
                    webparts and Web Services Enhancements). Mono supports ASP.NET 4.0 including Web Forms,
                    Microsoft AJAX, and ASP.NET MVC. While Mono supports ASP.NET MVC 3 applications, only MVC 2 is
                    currently installed by default because the Razor view engine, while available as open source, is
                    not anticipated to be included officially until the 2.12 release.

                <p>
                    ASP.NET provides a unified Web development model that includes the services necessary for you to
                    build enterprise-class Web applications. ASP.NET is part of the .NET Framework and enables you to
                    take full advantage of the features of the common language runtime (CLR), such as type safety,
                    inheritance, language interoperability, and versioning.<br><br>
                    When you use Visual Studio to create ASP.NET Web sites, you are actually using a part of the
                    integrated development environment (IDE) called Visual Web Developer. Visual Web Developer is
                    distinct from Visual C#; it has its own designer to create user interfaces on Web pages and other
                    tools for Web development and Web site administration. But when you create code-behind pages in C#
                    for your Web controls, you are using the C# code editor, and all the features of the editor are
                    available to you in Visual Web Developer just as they are in Visual C#.

                <h3>Java and it's Enterprise Edition version</h3>

                <p>
                    Java Platform, Enterprise Edition or Java EE is Oracle's enterprise Java computing platform. The
                    platform provides an API and runtime environment for developing and running enterprise software,
                    including network and web services, and other large-scale, multi-tiered, scalable, reliable, and
                    secure network applications. Java EE extends the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE),
                    providing an API for object-relational mapping, distributed and multi-tier architectures, and web
                    services. The platform incorporates a design based largely on modular components running on an
                    application server. Software for Java EE is primarily developed in the Java programming language.
                    The platform emphasizes convention over configuration and annotations for configuration.
                    Optionally XML can be used to override annotations or to deviate from the platform defaults.

            <p>During the development of the .NET Framework, the class libraries were originally written using a
                managed code compiler system called Simple Managed C (SMC). In January 1999, Anders Hejlsberg formed
                a team to build a new language at the time called Cool, which stood for "C-like Object Oriented
                Language". Microsoft had considered keeping the name "Cool" as the final name of the language, but
                chose not to do so for trademark reasons. By the time the .NET project was publicly announced at the
                July 2000 Professional Developers Conference, the language had been renamed C#, and the class
                libraries and ASP.NET runtime had been ported to C#.</p>
