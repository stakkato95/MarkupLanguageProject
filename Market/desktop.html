                <h3>Desktop application barriers</h3>

                <p>
                    The desktop is perhaps the single most important development in productivity in the history of
                    computing.<br><br>
                    We simply can't imagine using a computer without the Graphical User Interface; the intuitive ability
                    to click icons as opposed to memorising complex command lines revolutionised computers and made them
                    accessible to the masses.<br><br>
                    Whether you're a Windows, OSX, or perhaps Linux user, the same basic principles apply. Point and
                    click; a simple command that anyone can master. But dig a little deeper than the visual similarity
                    and each of these operating systems are markedly different.<br><br>
                    Very rarely will applications run across all platforms and, beyond the basic, it becomes
                    increasingly difficult to get the most out of all the features available across these operating
                    systems without in-depth knowledge of each. The biggest impediment to desktop productivity is the
                    lack of consistency.<br><br>
                    As a result, personal computing is now in an incredibly fragmented state. As PC sales decline it's
                    clear that mobile computing has irreversibly redefined the way we interact with technology. Users
                    now expect the same powerful tools and applications on the go as they do at home or in the
                    office.<br><br>
                    Ultimately, the device shouldn't dictate functionality since portability is no longer seen as a
                    barrier to how work is done. Function is instead firmly in the hands of the user, a trend which will
                    only grow stronger if you look at the recent focus on wearable technology.

                <h3>C# and WPF</h3>

                <p>
                    Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) is a next-generation presentation system for building Windows
                    client applications with visually stunning user experiences. With WPF, you can create a wide range
                    of both standalone and browser-hosted applications. An example is the Contoso Healthcare Sample
                    Application that is shown in the following figure.
                </p>

                <img src="../img/wpf_1.png">

                <p>
                    The core of WPF is a resolution-independent and vector-based rendering engine that is built to take
                    advantage of modern graphics hardware. WPF extends the core with a comprehensive set of
                    application-development features that include Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML),
                    controls, data binding, layout, 2-D and 3-D graphics, animation, styles, templates, documents,
                    media, text, and typography. WPF is included in the Microsoft .NET Framework, so you can build
                    applications that incorporate other elements of the .NET Framework class library.<br><br>
                    WPF exists as a subset of .NET Framework types that are for the most part located in the
                    System.Windows namespace. If you have previously built applications with .NET Framework using
                    managed technologies like ASP.NET and Windows Forms, the fundamental WPF programming experience
                    should be familiar; you instantiate classes, set properties, call methods, and handle events, all
                    using your favorite .NET Framework programming language, such as C# or Visual Basic.<br><br>
                    To support some of the more powerful WPF capabilities and to simplify the programming experience,
                    WPF includes additional programming constructs that enhance properties and events: dependency
                    properties and routed events.<br><br>
                    WPF offers additional programming enhancements for Windows client application development. One
                    obvious enhancement is the ability to develop an application using both markup and code-behind, an
                    experience that ASP.NET developers should be familiar with. You generally use Extensible Application
                    Markup Language (XAML) markup to implement the appearance of an application while using managed
                    programming languages (code-behind) to implement its behavior. This separation of appearance and
                    behavior has the following benefits:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Development and maintenance costs are reduced because appearance-specific markup is not tightly
                        coupled with behavior-specific code.
                    </li>
                    <li>Development is more efficient because designers can implement an application's appearance
                        simultaneously with developers who are implementing the application's behavior.
                    </li>
                    <li>Multiple design tools can be used to implement and share XAML markup, to target the requirements
                        of the application development contributors; Microsoft Expression Blend provides an experience
                        that suits designers, while Visual Studio 2005 targets developers.
                    </li>
                    <li>Globalization and localization for WPF applications is greatly simplified</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Java and FX</h3>

                <p>
                    JavaFX is a software platform for creating and delivering rich internet applications (RIAs) that can
                    run across a wide variety of devices. JavaFX is intended to replace Swing as the standard GUI
                    library for Java SE, but both will be included for the foreseeable future. The current release
                    has support for desktop computers and web browsers on Microsoft, Linux, and Mac OS X.<br><br>
                    Before version 2.0 of JavaFX, developers used a statically typed, declarative language called JavaFX
                    Script to build JavaFX applications. Because JavaFX Script was compiled to Java bytecode,
                    programmers could also use Java code instead. JavaFX applications could run on any desktop that
                    could run Java SE, on any browser that could run Java EE, or on any mobile phone that could run Java
                    ME.<br><br>
                    However, JavaFX 2.0 and later is now implemented as a native Java library and therefore applications
                    using JavaFX are written in native Java code. JavaFX Script has been scrapped by Oracle, but
                    development is being continued in the Visage project. JavaFX 2.x does not support the Solaris
                    operating system or mobile phones; however as Oracle plans to integrate JavaFX to Java SE embedded
                    8, Java FX for ARM processors is currently in developer preview phase.<br><br>
                    On desktops, the current release supports Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Mac OS X
                    and Linux operating systems. Beginning with JavaFX 1.2, Oracle has released beta versions for
                    OpenSolaris. On mobile, JavaFX Mobile 1.x is capable of running on multiple mobile operating
                    systems, including Symbian OS, Windows Mobile, and proprietary real-time operating systems.

                <p>
                    <b>Common profile</b><br><br>
                    JavaFX 1.1 was based on the concept of a "common profile" that is intended to span across all
                    devices supported by JavaFX. This approach makes it possible for developers to use a common
                    programming model while building an application targeted for both desktop and mobile devices and to
                    share much of the code, graphics assets and content between desktop and mobile versions.
                    To address the need for tuning applications on a specific class of devices, the JavaFX 1.1 platform
                    includes APIs that are desktop or mobile-specific. For example JavaFX Desktop profile includes Swing
                    and advanced visual effects.<br><br>
                    <b>Drag-to-Install</b><br><br>
                    From the point of view of the end user "Drag-to-Install" allows them to drag a JavaFX widget (or
                    application residing in a website and is visible within the browser window) and drop it onto their
                    desktop. The application will not lose its state or context even after the browser is closed. An
                    application can also be re-launched by clicking on a shortcut that gets created automatically on the
                    user's desktop.
                    This behavior is enabled out-of-the-box by the Java applet mechanism since Java 6 update 10 and is
                    leveraged by JavaFX from the underlying Java layer.
                    Sun touts "Drag-to-Install" as opening up of a new distribution model and allowing developers to
                    "break away from the browser".<br><br>
                    <b>Integrating graphics created with third-party tools</b><br><br>
                    JavaFX 1.x included a set of plug-ins for Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator that enable advanced
                    graphics to be integrated directly into JavaFX applications. The plug-ins generate JavaFX Script
                    code that preserves layers and structure of the graphics. Developers can then easily add animation
                    or effects to the static graphics imported.
                    There was also an SVG graphics converter tool (a.k.a. Media Factory) that allows for importing
                    graphics and previewing assets after the conversion to JavaFX format.
