                <h3>C#</h3>

                <h3>1. Initializers for auto-properties</h3>

                <p>
                    You can now add an initializer to an auto-property, just as you can a field:
                </p>

                <pre>public class Customer
{
    public string First { get; set; } = "Jane";
    public string Last { get; set; } = "Doe";
}</pre>

                <p>
                    The initializer directly initializes the backing field; it doesn't work through the setter of the
                    auto-property. For this reason it now makes sense to have auto-properties without setters:
                </p>

                <pre>public class Customer
{
    public string First { get; } = "Jane";
    public string Last { get; } = "Doe";
}</pre>

                <p>
                    Getter-only auto-props are allowed as long as there's an initializer. Otherwise it would never be
                    able to contain any other value than the default value of the type.<br><br>
                    Just like field initializers, auto-property initializers cannot reference 'this' - after all they
                    are executed before the object is properly initialized. This would mean that there aren't a whole
                    lot of interesting choices for what to initialize the auto-properties to. Especially getter-only
                    auto-properties would seem kind of useless if they couldn't somehow acquire values passed in to
                    constructors of the object. However, primary constructors change that. Auto-property initializers
                    and primary constructors thus enhance each other.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Primary constructors</h3>

                <p>
                    Primary constructors allow constructor parameters to be declared directly on the class or struct,
                    without an explicit constructor declaration in the body of the type declaration. These parameters
                    are in scope as simple names for initialization throughout the whole class declaration.<br><br>
                    Note: We changed the design, and the following describes the new design. However, the changes didn't
                    make it in in time for the preview build, so you'll still see the old semantics: parameters are
                    captured implicitly and there is no syntax for explicit capture.
                </p>

                <h3>2.1 Parameters on classes and structs</h3>

                <p>
                    Here's an example of a class with a primary constructor:
                </p>

                <pre>public class Customer(string first, string last)
{
    public string First { get; } = first;
    public string Last { get; } = last;
}</pre>

                <p>
                    Achieving the same effect without primary constructors would have required private fields to hold
                    the values of first and last, an explicit constructor to initialize them, and a getter body in First
                    and Last to expose them:
                </p>

                <pre>public class Customer
{
    private string first;
    private string last;

    public string First { get { return first; } }
    public string Last { get { return last; } }

    public Customer(string first, string last)
    {
        this.first = first;
        this.last = last;
    }

}</pre>
                <p>
                    Just to give you a sense of how much boilerplate this saves, I've highlighted the unnecessary chunks
                    that are removed by the use of primary constructor and initialized getter-only
                    auto-properties.<br><br>
                    This is about expressing types more concisely, but note that it also removes an important difference
                    in the language between mutable and immutable types: auto-properties were a shorthand available only
                    if you were willing to make your class mutable, and so the temptation to default to that was great.
                    Now, with getter-only auto-properties, the playing field has been leveled between mutable and
                    immutable.<br><br>
                    There is currently no way to specify an explicit constructor body for a primary constructor. We
                    didn't land on a good syntax for this, and are not sure how important it is, since most of
                    constructor bodies are usually initialization anyway. However, many have brought up constructor
                    argument validation as something you'd often want to express.<br><br>
                </p>

                <h3>2.2 Field parameters</h3>

                <p>
                    Note: Field parameters don't work in the current prototype.<br><br>
                    By default, a primary constructor parameter is only around at initialization time. Function members
                    such as properties and methods cannot refer to it, because by the time they are called, the object
                    has been constructed and the parameter is gone.<br><br>
                    We considered (and experimented with) letting parameters be implicitly "captured" into compiler
                    generated private fields if they were used after construction, but that lead to wasteful and buggy
                    code where parameters were too often unintentionally captured into fields.<br><br>
                    Of course you can declare your own private field and initialize it with a parameter:
                </p>

                <pre>public class Customer(string first, string last, DateTime bday)
{
    public string First { get; } = first;
    public string Last { get; } = last;

    private DateTime _bday = bday;
}</pre>

                <p>
                    Unfortunately the private field wouldn't be able to use the same name as the parameter, and needs an
                    alternative name, e.g. with an underbar in front.<br><br>
                    To avoid this, we give you syntax to explicitly capture primary constructor parameters into fields:
                </p>

                <pre>public class Customer(string first, string last, private DateTime bday)
{
    public string First { get; } = first;
    public string Last { get; } = last;
}</pre>

                <p>
                    When you put an accessibility modifier (most likely private) on a primary constructor parameter it
                    means make a parameter and a field with the same name, and initialize the field with the parameter.
                    This way, you get to reference it in methods and properties, not just during initialization:
                </p>

                <pre>public int Age { get { return ComputeAge(bday); } }</pre>

                <h3>2.3 Explicit constructors</h3>

                <p>
                    A class declaration with a primary constructor can still define other constructors. However, to
                    ensure that arguments actually get passed to the primary constructor parameters, all other
                    constructors must call a this(…) initializer:
                </p>

                <pre>public Point() : this(0, 0) {} // calls the primary constructor</pre>

                <h3>2.4 Base initializer</h3>

                <p>
                    The primary constructor always implicitly or explicitly calls a base initializer. If no base
                    initializer is specified, just like all constructors it will default to calling a parameterless base
                    constructor.<br><br>
                    The way to explicitly call the base initializer is to pass an argument list to a base class
                    specifier:
                </p>

                <pre>class BufferFullException() : Exception("Buffer full") { … }</pre>

                <h3>3. Using static</h3>

                <p>
                    Note: The current implementation of this feature does not reflect the current design. More details
                    below.<br><br>
                    The feature allows specifying a type in a using clause, making all the accessible static members of
                    the type available without qualification in subsequent code:
                </p>

                <pre>using System.Console;
using System.Math;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        WriteLine(Sqrt(3*3 + 4*4));
    }
}</pre>
                <p>
                    This feature clearly has the ability to make your code shorter. There's a concern that it can
                    clutter up your namespace, and cause weird ambiguities, especially with classes that weren't
                    authored to be "opened up" like that. How many Create(…) methods can one handle without being
                    confused about what you're creating?
                </p>

                <h3>3.1 Extension methods</h3>

                <p>
                    Extension methods are static methods. This raises a question about how a using static should bring
                    them in. As a top level method in scope? As an extension method? Both? Let's look at an example:
                </p>

                <pre>using System.Linq.Enumerable; // Just the type, not the whole namespace

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var range = Range(5, 17); // (1)

        var odd = Where(range, i => i % 2 == 1); // (2)

        var even = range.Where(i => i % 2 == 0); // (3)
    }
}</pre>
                <p>
                    Range is an ordinary static method so the call marked (1) is and should be allowed. The current
                    implementation doesn't do anything special for extension methods, so it allows the call to Where as
                    a static method in (2), but not as an extension method in (3).<br><br>
                    This is not what we intend. Allowing (3) would give us a long asked-for way to bring in extension
                    methods more selectively per type they are defined in, rather than just per namespace. On the other
                    hand, extension methods were rarely designed to be used as static methods (that is just a fallback
                    for the rare case where there are ambiguities), and we do not really want them to clutter up the
                    top-level namespace. So we want to disallow (2). We hope to make these changes in a future CTP.
                </p>

                <h3>4. Declaration expressions</h3>

                <p>
                    Declaration expressions allow you to declare local variables in the middle of an expression, with or
                    without an initializer. Here are some examples:
                </p>

                <pre>if (int.TryParse(s, out int i)) { … }

GetCoordinates(out var x, out var y);

Console.WriteLine("Result: {0}", (int x = GetValue()) * x);

if ((string s = o as string) != null) { … s … }</pre>

                <p>
                    This is particularly useful for out parameters, where you no longer have to declare variables on a
                    separate line to pass in. This is neat even in the best of cases, but in some scenarios where only
                    expressions are allowed, it is necessary for using out parameters. In query clauses for example:
                </p>

                <pre>from s in strings
select int.TryParse(s, out int i) ? i : -1;</pre>

                <h3>5. Exception filters</h3>

                <p>
                    VB has them. F# has them. Now C# has them too. This is what they look like:
                </p>

                <pre>try { … }

catch (MyException e) if (myfilter(e))
{
 …
}</pre>
                <p>
                    If the parenthesized expression evaluates to true, the catch block is run, otherwise the exception
                    keeps going.<br><br>
                    Exception filters are preferable to catching and rethrowing because they leave the stack unharmed.
                    If the exception later causes the stack to be dumped, you can see where it originally came from,
                    rather than just the last place it was rethrown.
                </p>

                <h3>6. Binary literals and digit separators</h3>

                <p>
                    We want to allow binary literals in C#. No longer will you need to belong to the secret brotherhood
                    of Hex in order to specify bit vectors or flags values!
                </p>

                <pre>var bits = 0b00101110;</pre>

                <p>For long literals (and these new binary ones can easily get long!) being able to specify digits in
                    groups also seems useful. C# will allow an underbar '_' in literals to separate such groups:</p>

                <pre>var bits = 0b0010_1110;

var hex = 0x00_2E;

var dec = 1_234_567_890;</pre>

                <p>
                    You can put as many as you want, wherever you want, except at the front.
                </p>

                <h3>7. Indexed members and element initializers</h3>

                <p>
                    Object and collection initializers are useful for declaratively initializing fields and properties
                    of objects, or giving a collection an initial set of elements. Initializing dictionaries is less
                    elegant. We are adding a new syntax to object initializers allowing you to set values to keys
                    through any indexer that the new object has:
                </p>

                <pre>var numbers = new Dictionary<int, string>
{
    [7] = "seven",
    [9] = "nine",
    [13] = "thirteen"
};</pre>
                <p>
                    Specifically if the keys are strings, you sometimes want to think of them almost as a weak kind of
                    members of the object. This is the case for instance if you have semi-structured data in wire
                    formats such as JSON, that is "object-like" but not strongly typed in C# itself. We are adding a
                    syntax for "indexed members", which let you pretend that a literal string key is a sort of member:
                </p>

                <pre>var customer = new JsonData
{
    $first = "Anders", // => ["first"] = "Anders"
    $last = "Hejlsberg" // => ["last"] = "Hejlsberg"
}

string first = customer.$first; // => customer["first"]</pre>

                <p>
                    Indexed members are indicated by a \$ sign, and can be used in object initializers and member
                    access. They just translate down to indexing with string literals, so they can be used wherever the
                    receiving object has an indexer that takes a single string index.
                </p>

                <h3>8. Await in catch and finally blocks</h3>

                <p>
                    In C# 5.0 we don't allow the await keyword in catch and finally blocks, because we'd somehow
                    convinced ourselves that it wasn't possible to implement. Now we've figured it out, so apparently it
                    wasn't impossible after all.<br><br>
                    This has actually been a significant limitation, and people have had to employ unsightly workarounds
                    to compensate. That is no longer necessary:
                </p>

                <pre>Resource res = null;

try
{
    res = await Resource.OpenAsync(…); // You could do this.
    …
}
catch(ResourceException e)
{
    await Resource.LogAsync(res, e); // Now you can do this …
}
finally
{
    if (res != null) await res.CloseAsync(); // … and this.
}</pre>
                <p>
                    The implementation is quite complicated, but you don't have to worry about that. That's the whole
                    point of having async in the language.
                </p>

                <h3>9. Extension Add methods in collection initializers</h3>

                <p>
                    When we first implemented collection initializers in C#, the Add methods that get called couldn't be
                    extension methods. VB got it right from the start, but it seems we forgot about it in C#. This has
                    been fixed: the code generated from a collection initializer will now happily call an extension
                    method called Add. It's not much of a feature, but it's occasionally useful, and it turned out
                    implementing it in the new compiler amounted to removing a check that prevented it.<br><br>

                <h3>Java</h3>

                <h3>1. Project Jigsaw – Modular Source Code</h3>

                <p>
                    Project Jigsaw’s goal is to make Java modular and break the JRE to interoperable components, one of
                    the most hyped features for Java 9. This JEP is the first out of 4 steps towards Jigsaw and will not
                    change the actual structure of the JRE and JDK. The purpose of this step is to reorganize the JDK
                    source code into modules, enhance the build system to compile modules, and enforce module boundaries
                    at build time. The project was originally intended for Java 8 but was delayed since and retargeted
                    at Java 9.<br><br>
                    Once it’s finished, it would allow creating a scaled down runtime Jar (rt.jar) customised to the
                    components a project actually needs. The JDK 7 and JDK 8 rt.jar’s have about 20,000 classes that are
                    part of the JDK even if many of them aren’t really being used in a specific envrionment (although a
                    partial solution is included in the Java 8 compact profiles feature). The motivation behind this is
                    to make Java easily scalable to small computing devices (Internet of Things), improve security and
                    performance, and make it easier for developers to construct and maintain libraries.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Process API Updates</h3>

                <p>
                    So far there has been a limited ability for controlling and managing operating system processes with
                    Java. For example, in order to do something as simple as get your process PID today, you would need
                    to either access native code or use some sort of a workaround. More than that, it would require a
                    different implementation for each platform to guarantee you’re getting the right result.<br><br>
                    In Java 9, expect the code for retrieving Linux PIDs, that now looks like this:
                </p>
                <pre>public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
   Process proc = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(new String[]{ "/bin/sh", "-c", "echo $PPID" });

   if (proc.waitFor() == 0) {
      InputStream in = proc.getInputStream();
      int available = in.available();
      byte[] outputBytes = new byte[available];

      in.read(outputBytes);
      String pid = new String(outputBytes);

      System.out.println("Your pid is " + pid);
   }
}</pre>
                <p>
                    To turn into something like this (that also supports all operating systems):
                </p>

                <pre>System.out.println("Your pid is " + Process.getCurrentPid());</pre>

                <p>
                    The update will extend Java’s ability to to interact with the operating system: New direct methods
                    to handle PIDs, process names and states, and ability to enumerate JVMs and processes and more.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Light-Weight JSON API</h3>

                <p>
                    Currently there are alternatives available for handling JSON in Java, what’s unique about this API
                    is
                    that it would be part of the language, lightweight and would use the new capabilities of Java 8. And
                    will be delivered right through java.util (Unlike JSR 353 which uses an external package or other
                    alternatives).
                </p>

                <h3>4. Money and Currency API</h3>

                <p>
                    After the new Date and Time API introduced in Java 8, Java 9 brings with it a new and official API
                    for representing, transporting, and performing comprehensive calculations with Money and Currency.
                    To find out more about the project, you can visit JavaMoney on Github. Code and usage examples are
                    already available right here . Here are a few highlights:
                </p>

                <pre>Money amt1 = Money.of(10.1234556123456789, "USD"); // Money is a BigDecimal
FastMoney amt2 = FastMoney.of(123456789, "USD"); // FastMoney is up to 5 decimal places
Money total = amt1.add(amt2);</pre>

                <p>
                    The new money types: Money & FastMoney
                </p>

                <pre>MonetaryAmountFormat germanFormat = MonetaryFormats.getAmountFormat(Locale.GERMANY);
System.out.println(germanFormat.format(monetaryAmount)); // 1.202,12 USD</pre>

                <h3>5. Improve Contended Locking</h3>

                <p>
                    Lock contention is a performance bottleneck for many multithreaded Java applications. The
                    enhancement proposal looks into improving the performance of Java object monitors as measured by
                    different benchmarks. One of the these tests is Volano. It simulates a chat server with huge thread
                    counts and client connections, many of them trying to access the same resources and simulate a heavy
                    duty real world application.<br><br>
                    These kind of stress tests push JVMs to the limit and try to determine the maximum throughput they
                    can achieve, usually in terms of messages per second. The ambitious success metric for this JEP is a
                    significant improvement over 22 different benchmarks. If the effort will succeed, these performance
                    improvements will be rolling out in Java 9.
                </p>

                <h3>6. Segmented Code Cache</h3>

                <p>
                    Another performance improvement for Java 9 is coming from the JIT compiler angle. When certain areas
                    of code are executed rapidly, the VM compiles them to native code and stores them in the code cache.
                    This update looks into segmenting the code cache to different areas of compiled code in order to
                    improve the compiler’s performance.<br><br>
                    Instead of a single area, the code cache will be segmented into 3 by the code’s lifetime in the
                    cache:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Code that will stay in the cache forever (JVM internal / non-method code)</li>
                    <li>Short lifetime (Profiled code, specific to a certain set of conditions)</li>
                    <li>Potentially long lifetime (Non-profiled code)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The segmentation would allow for several performance improvements to happen. For example, the method
                    sweeper would be able to skip non-method code and act faster.
                </p>

                <h3>7. Smart Java Compilation, Phase Two</h3>

                <p>
                    The Smart Java Compilation tool, or sjavac, was first worked on around JEP 139 in order to improve
                    JDK build speeds by having the javac compiler run on all cores. With JEP 199, it enters Phase Two,
                    where it will be improved and generalized so that it can be used by default and build other projects
                    than the JDK.
                </p>

                <h3>8. HTTP 2 Client</h3>

                <p>
                    HTTP 2.0 hasn’t been released yet as a standard but it will be submitted for final review soon and
                    it’s expected to be finalized before the release of Java 9. JEP 110 will define and implement a new
                    HTTP client for Java that will replace HttpURLConnection, and also implement HTTP 2.0 and
                    websockets. It wasn’t published as an accepted JEP yet but its targeting Java 9 and we expect it to
                    be included.<br><br>
                    The official HTTP 2.0 RFC release date is currently set to February 2015, building on top of
                    Google’s SPDY algorithm. SPDY has already shown great speed improvements over HTTP 1.1 ranging
                    between 11.81% to 47.7% and its implementation already exists in most modern browsers.
                </p>

                <h3>9. Project Kulla – REPL in Java</h3>

                <p>
                    Recently announced, a bit unlikely to hit Java 9 but might make it on time with a targeted
                    integration date set in April 2015. Today there’s no “native” Java way to REPL
                    (Read-Eval-Print-Loop). Meaning, if you want to run a few lines of Java to check out them quickly on
                    their own you will have to wrap it all in a separate project or method. There are REPL add-ons to
                    popular IDEs and some other solutions like Java REPL, but no official way to do this so far –
                    Project Kulla might be the answer.
