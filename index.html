                    The actual range of primitive data types that is available is dependent upon the specific
                    programming language that is being used. For example, in C, strings are a composite but built-in
                    data type, whereas in modern dialects of BASIC and in JavaScript, they are assimilated to a
                    primitive data type that is both basic and built-in.<br>
                    Classic basic primitive types may include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Character</li>
                    <li>Integer</li>
                    <li>Floating-point number</li>
                    <li>Fixed-point number</li>
                    <li>Boolean</li>
                    <li>Reference (also called a pointer or handle), a small value referring to another object's address
                        in
                        memory, possibly a much larger one.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Both languages define enumerations, but they are implemented in fundamentally different ways. As
                    such, enumerations are one area where tools designed to automatically translate code between the two
                    languages (such as Java to C# converters) fail.<br><br>
                    C# has implemented enumerations in a manner similar to C, that is as wrappers around the bit-flags
                    implemented in primitive integral types (int, byte, short, etc.). This has performance benefits and
                    improves interaction with C/C++ compiled code, but provides fewer features and can lead to bugs if
                    low-level value types are directly cast to an enumeration type, as is allowed in the C# language. In
                    contrast, Java implements enumerations as full featured collection of instances, requiring more
                    memory and not aiding interaction with C/C++ code, but providing additional features in reflection
                    and intrinsic behavior. The implementation in each language is described in the table below.

                <p>During the development of the .NET Framework, the class libraries were originally written using a
                    managed code compiler system called Simple Managed C (SMC). In January 1999, Anders Hejlsberg formed
                    a team to build a new language at the time called Cool, which stood for "C-like Object Oriented
                    Language". Microsoft had considered keeping the name "Cool" as the final name of the language, but
                    chose not to do so for trademark reasons. By the time the .NET project was publicly announced at the
                    July 2000 Professional Developers Conference, the language had been renamed C#, and the class
                    libraries and ASP.NET runtime had been ported to C#.<br/><br/>

                    C#'s principal designer and lead architect at Microsoft is Anders Hejlsberg, who was previously
                    involved with the design of Turbo Pascal, Embarcadero Delphi (formerly CodeGear Delphi, Inprise
                    Delphi and Borland Delphi), and Visual J++. In interviews and technical papers he has stated that
                    flaws in most major programming languages (e.g. C++, Java, Delphi, and Smalltalk) drove the
                    fundamentals of the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which, in turn, drove the design of the C#
                    language itself.

            <p>In computer science, garbage collection (GC) is a form of automatic memory management. The garbage
                collector, or just collector, attempts to reclaim garbage, or memory occupied by objects that are no
                longer in use by the program. Garbage collection was invented by John McCarthy around 1959 to solve
                problems in Lisp.<br><br>
                Garbage collection is often portrayed as the opposite of manual memory management, which requires
                the programmer to specify which objects to deallocate and return to the memory system. However, many
                systems use a combination of approaches, including other techniques such as stack allocation and
                region inference. Like other memory management techniques, garbage collection may take a significant
                proportion of total processing time in a program and can thus have significant influence on
                performance.
