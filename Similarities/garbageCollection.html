                <h3>What is garbage collection</h3>

                <p>
                    In computer science, garbage collection (GC) is a form of automatic memory management. The garbage
                    collector, or just collector, attempts to reclaim garbage, or memory occupied by objects that are no
                    longer in use by the program. Garbage collection was invented by John McCarthy around 1959 to solve
                    problems in Lisp.<br><br>
                    Garbage collection is often portrayed as the opposite of manual memory management, which requires
                    the programmer to specify which objects to deallocate and return to the memory system. However, many
                    systems use a combination of approaches, including other techniques such as stack allocation and
                    region inference. Like other memory management techniques, garbage collection may take a significant
                    proportion of total processing time in a program and can thus have significant influence on
                    performance.<br><br>
                    Resources other than memory, such as network sockets, database handles, user interaction windows,
                    and file and device descriptors, are not typically handled by garbage collection. Methods used to
                    manage such resources, particularly destructors, may suffice to manage memory as well, leaving no
                    need for GC. Some GC systems allow such other resources to be associated with a region of memory
                    that, when collected, causes the other resource to be reclaimed; this is called finalization.
                    Finalization may introduce complications limiting its usability, such as intolerable latency between
                    disuse and reclaim of especially limited resources, or a lack of control over which thread performs
                    the work of reclaiming.

                <h3>Principles of garbage collection</h3>

                <p>
                    The basic principles of garbage collection are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Find data objects in a program that cannot be accessed in the future.</li>
                    <li>Reclaim the resources used by those objects.</li>
                </ul>


                Many programming languages require garbage collection, either as part of the language specification
                (for example, Java, C#, D language, Go and most scripting languages) or effectively for practical
                implementation (for example, formal languages like lambda calculus); these are said to be garbage
                collected languages. Other languages were designed for use with manual memory management, but have
                garbage collected implementations available (for example, C, C++). Some languages, like Ada,
                Modula-3, and C++/CLI allow both garbage collection and manual memory management to co-exist in the
                same application by using separate heaps for collected and manually managed objects; others, like D,
                are garbage collected but allow the user to manually delete objects and also entirely disable
                garbage collection when speed is required.<br><br>
                While integrating garbage collection into the language's compiler and runtime system enables a much
                wider choice of methods,[citation needed] post hoc GC systems exist, including some that do not
                require recompilation. (Post-hoc GC is sometimes distinguished as litter collection.) The garbage
                collector will almost always be closely integrated with the memory allocator.

                <h3>Advantages of garbage collection</h3>

                <p>
                    Garbage collection frees the programmer from manually dealing with memory deallocation. As a result,
                    certain categories of bugs are eliminated or substantially reduced:
                <ul>
                    <li>Dangling pointer bugs, which occur when a piece of memory is freed while there are still
                        pointers to it, and one of those pointers is dereferenced. By then the memory may have been
                        reassigned to another use, with unpredictable results.
                    </li>
                    <li>Double free bugs, which occur when the program tries to free a region of memory that has already
                        been freed, and perhaps already been allocated again.
                    </li>
                    <li>Certain kinds of memory leaks, in which a program fails to free memory occupied by objects that
                        have become unreachable, which can lead to memory exhaustion. (Garbage collection typically does
                        not deal with the unbounded accumulation of data that is reachable, but that will actually not
                        be used by the program.)
                    </li>
                    <li>Efficient implementations of persistent data structures</li>
                </ul>
                Some of the bugs addressed by garbage collection can have security implications.

                <h3>Disadvantages of garbage collection</h3>

                <p>
                    Typically, garbage collection has certain disadvantages:
                <ul>
                    <li>Garbage collection consumes computing resources in deciding which memory to free, even though
                        the programmer may have already known this information. The penalty for the convenience of not
                        annotating object lifetime manually in the source code is overhead, which can lead to decreased
                        or uneven performance. A peer reviewed paper came to the conclusion that GC needs five times the
                        memory to compensate for this overhead and to perform as fast as explicit memory management.[4]
                        Interaction with memory hierarchy effects can make this overhead intolerable in circumstances
                        that are hard to predict or to detect in routine testing. The impact on performance was also
                        given as reason by Apple for not adopting GC for iOS despit being the top wishlisted feature.
                    </li>
                    <li>The moment when the garbage is actually collected can be unpredictable, resulting in stalls
                        scattered throughout a session. Unpredictable stalls can be unacceptable in real-time
                        environments, in transaction processing, or in interactive programs. Incremental, concurrent,
                        and real-time garbage collectors address these problems, with varying trade-offs.
                    </li>
                    <li>Non-deterministic GC is incompatible with RAII based management of non-GCed resources. As a
                        result, the need for explicit manual resource management (release/close) for non-GCed resources
                        becomes transitive to composition. That is: in a non-deterministic GC system, if a resource or a
                        resource-like object requires manual resource management (release/close), and this object is
                        used as 'part of' another object, then the composed object will also become a resource-like
                        object that itself requires manual resource management (release/close).
                    </li>
                </ul>
